# Exercise 2.1: code a function named is_even that has one int parameter, and use the % operator to return a boolean (true if even, false if odd).

# Exercise 2.2: code a function named is_prime that has one int parameter, and use the % operator to return a boolean (true if prime, false if not prime).

# Exercise 2.3: code a function named is_odd_and_prime that has one int parameter, and use the % operator to return a boolean (true if odd and prime, false if not odd and prime).

# Exercise 2.4: code a function named is_even_and_not_prime that has one int parameter, and use the % operator to return a boolean (true if even and not prime, false if not even and not prime).
